## Contribution

Currently this project is closed for contribution.  It is strictly a learning bed for myself at the moment.  If you would like to use the code the code is available under GPL 3.

## TODO List

The following todo shows the current list of opcodes needing implemented.  I will hopefully soon have all the opcode decoded, only requiring implementation.
